# Translation-System
Developed by Ayotomiwa Adekunle.
This was a project I created while I was still a 1st year in my university, I ask you please excuse some of the poor aspects of the code.

Essentialy, the specification for this project was to emulate the process that Machine translation systems operated on.
The program downloads a language pair data set eg. EN-ES (This is english and spanish).
The program handles cases where a data set is unavailable.
The user is then able to split the data set into a training, testing and validation set.
The user is then able to input keywords and return the desired line.
The user can also perform small scale translations by splitting the parallel lines.
Note: Each line in each language pair is a parallel line, for example in the EN-ES language pair the first sentence is in english while on the same line the next sentence is in spanish.
Note: The language pairs may not be available due to either authorisation issues or they have been removed from my university's website.
